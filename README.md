# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

- Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a smart computer player that would never loss if it start first -- the result would only be a win or a tie with the human player.
- Analyzed possible cases on a three by three gameboard, and create algorithms for the smart computer player.
- Implemented and optimized algorithms for the smart computer player such that it calculates and makes the best move based
on the last move of the human player.
